# Sequence Kit In-Game Marketplace Boilerplate

## Coming Soon!

Starter Sequence boilerplate demonstrating how to build an in-game NFT marketplate using Sequence.

## Quickstart

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill with your project information. To test things out, you can use the pre-provided keys in the `.env.example` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then install and run:

```js
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

The app will start on `localhost:4444`

To provide your own keys from [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/), simply edit the `.env` file accordingly.
